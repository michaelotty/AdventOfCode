## Michael's Advent of Code

I want to do each day in whichever language seems easiest. Probably python most
the time, but I am interested in learning a parser generator such as bison/flex
for a challenge that suits this, which there have been in the past AoC.
Otherwise, I may do the challenge in C++ just for the lols sometimes since I use
that at work as well.

To build, use cmake. The doxygen documentation requires `graphviz` for graphs.
